    "Here's a simple implementation of a singly linked list in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "\n",
    "class LinkedList:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.head = None\n",
    "\n",
    "    def append(self, data):\n",
    "        new_node = Node(data)\n",
    "        if not self.head:\n",
    "            self.head = new_node\n",
    "            return\n",
    "        last = self.head\n",
    "        while last.next:\n",
    "            last = last.next\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "- Use linked lists when you need to frequently add or remove elements from the middle of the list.\n",
    "- Consider using a doubly linked list if you need to traverse the list in both directions.\n",
    "- Keep track of the head and tail nodes to optimize insertion and deletion operations."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for the next (and previous) pointer.\n",
    "- **Traversal Time**: Accessing elements by index is slower compared to arrays because you need to traverse the list.\n",
    "- **Dangling Pointers**: Be cautious of pointers that reference deleted nodes."

    "## Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question**: How do you reverse a singly linked list?\n",
    "   **Answer**: Iterate through the list, reversing the pointers as you go.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def reverse(self):\n",
    "        prev = None\n",
    "        current = self.head\n",
    "        while current:\n",
    "            next_node = current.next\n",
    "            current.next = prev\n",
    "            prev = current\n",
    "            current = next_node\n",
    "        self.head = prev\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question**: How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?\n",
    "   **Answer**: Use the Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def has_cycle(self):\n",
    "        slow = self.head\n",
    "        fast = self.head\n",
    "        while fast and fast.next:\n",
    "            slow = slow.next\n",
    "            fast = fast.next.next\n",
    "            if slow == fast:\n",
    "                return True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Question**: How do you find the middle element of a linked list?\n",
    "   **Answer**: Use two pointers, one moving twice as fast as the other.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def find_middle(self):\n",
    "        slow = self.head\n",
    "        fast = self.head\n",
    "        while fast and fast.next:\n",
    "            slow = slow.next\n",
