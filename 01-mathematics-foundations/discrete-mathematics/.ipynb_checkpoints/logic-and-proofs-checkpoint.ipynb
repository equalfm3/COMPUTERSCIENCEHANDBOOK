    "```\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "1. Let n be even\n",

    "```\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "1. Assume √2 is rational\n",

    "## Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question**: What is the difference between implication and equivalence?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: Implication (P → Q) means if P is true, then Q must be true, but Q can be true when P is false. Equivalence (P ↔ Q) means P and Q must have the same truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question**: Explain De Morgan's Laws and why they are important.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: De Morgan's Laws state that ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q) and ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q). They are important because they allow us to simplify logical expressions and are fundamental in digital circuit design and Boolean algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Question**: How would you prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: Use proof by contradiction:\n",
    "   1. Assume there are finitely many primes: p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ\n",
    "   2. Consider N = (p₁ × p₂ × ... × pₙ) + 1\n",
    "   3. N is either prime or composite\n",
    "   4. If composite, it must have a prime factor from our list\n",
    "   5. But when divided by any prime from our list, it gives remainder 1\n",
    "   6. Contradiction!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Question**: What is the difference between universal and existential quantifiers?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: Universal quantifier (∀) means \"for all\" and claims something is true for every element in the domain. Existential quantifier (∃) means \"there exists\" and claims something is true for at least one element in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Question**: Explain the principle of mathematical induction.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: Mathematical induction has two steps:\n",
    "   1. Base case: Prove P(1) is true\n",
    "   2. Inductive step: Prove that if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true\n",
    "   This allows us to conclude P(n) is true for all positive integers n."
