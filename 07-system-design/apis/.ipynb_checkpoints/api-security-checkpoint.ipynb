    "## Detailed Explanation\n\n### Authentication\nAuthentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Common authentication methods include:\n- **API Keys**: Simple tokens used to identify the client.\n- **OAuth**: An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication.\n- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Self-contained tokens that can be used to securely transmit information between parties.\n\n### Authorization\nAuthorization determines what actions a user or system is allowed to perform. It is typically implemented after authentication. Common authorization mechanisms include:\n- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning permissions based on user roles.\n- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Assigning permissions based on user attributes.\n\n### Encryption\nEncryption is the process of protecting data by converting it into a secure format. Common encryption methods include:\n- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Encrypting data in transit using HTTPS.\n- **End-to-End Encryption**: Encrypting data from the sender to the recipient, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read the data.\n\n### API Gateway\nAn API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for all requests to your API. It provides features like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring, helping to secure and manage your API.\n\n### OAuth\nOAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication. It allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials."

    "## Best Practices\n- Use strong authentication methods like OAuth or JWT.\n- Implement role-based or attribute-based access control for authorization.\n- Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS.\n- Use an API Gateway to centralize security features.\n- Regularly review and update your security practices."

    "## Common Pitfalls\n- **Weak Authentication**: Using weak or outdated authentication methods can leave your API vulnerable to attacks.\n- **Insufficient Authorization**: Failing to implement proper authorization can allow unauthorized actions.\n- **Lack of Encryption**: Not encrypting data in transit can expose sensitive information to eavesdroppers.\n- **Unsecured API Gateway**: Failing to secure your API Gateway can leave your API vulnerable to attacks."

    "## Interview Questions\n\n1. **Question**: What is the difference between authentication and authorization?\n   **Answer**: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, while authorization determines what actions a user or system is allowed to perform.\n\n2. **Question**: What is OAuth?\n   **Answer**: OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication.\n\n3. **Question**: Why is encryption important for API security?\n   **Answer**: Encryption protects data by converting it into a secure format, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to eavesdroppers."
