    "## Detailed Explanation\n\n### API Lifecycle Management\nAPI lifecycle management involves managing the entire lifecycle of an API, from design to retirement. This includes:\n- **Design**: Defining the API's functionality, endpoints, and data formats.\n- **Development**: Implementing the API based on the design.\n- **Testing**: Verifying that the API works as expected.\n- **Deployment**: Making the API available for use.\n- **Monitoring**: Tracking the performance and usage of the API.\n- **Maintenance**: Updating and improving the API over time.\n- **Retirement**: Deprecating and removing the API when it is no longer needed.\n\n### API Gateway\nAn API Gateway is a server that acts as an entry point for all requests to your API. It provides features like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring, helping to secure and manage your API.\n\n### Developer Portal\nA Developer Portal is a platform where developers can discover, try out, and integrate with your APIs. It typically includes documentation, sample code, and interactive API consoles.\n\n### Monitoring and Analytics\nMonitoring and analytics involve tracking the performance and usage of your API to identify issues and optimize performance. This includes tracking metrics like request volume, response times, and error rates.\n\n### API Versioning\nAPI versioning allows you to make changes to your API without breaking existing clients. Common versioning strategies include:\n- **URL Versioning**: Include the version number in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`).\n- **Header Versioning**: Include the version number in the request header.\n- **Query Parameter Versioning**: Include the version number as a query parameter (e.g., `/api/resource?version=1`)."

    "## Best Practices\n- Use an API Gateway to centralize security and management features.\n- Provide a comprehensive Developer Portal to help developers understand and use your API.\n- Implement monitoring and analytics to track the performance and usage of your API.\n- Use versioning to manage changes to your API without breaking existing clients.\n- Regularly review and update your API management practices."

    "## Common Pitfalls\n- **Lack of API Lifecycle Management**: Failing to manage the entire lifecycle of your API can lead to issues down the line.\n- **Unsecured API Gateway**: Failing to secure your API Gateway can leave your API vulnerable to attacks.\n- **Inadequate Developer Portal**: Providing inadequate documentation and resources can make it difficult for developers to use your API.\n- **Insufficient Monitoring**: Failing to monitor your API can make it difficult to identify and resolve issues.\n- **Poor Versioning**: Failing to implement proper versioning can break existing clients when changes are made to the API."
