    "## Overview\n",
    "Database sharding is a scaling technique where a database is split into smaller, more manageable pieces, called shards. Each shard holds a subset of the data, and together they form the complete database. This approach allows for better performance, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing the load across multiple servers."

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Shard**: A subset of the database.\n",
    "- **Shard Key**: A value used to determine which shard a piece of data belongs to.\n",
    "- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Dividing data across multiple shards based on a shard key.\n",
    "- **Data Distribution**: Ensuring data is evenly distributed across shards to balance the load."

    "## Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "Database sharding works by partitioning the database into multiple shards, each containing a subset of the data. This allows for parallel processing and reduces the load on any single server. The shard key is used to determine which shard a piece of data belongs to, ensuring that related data is stored together where possible."

    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "To implement database sharding, you typically need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Shard Key**: Select a value that will be used to distribute data across shards.\n",
    "2. **Partition Data**: Divide the data into shards based on the shard key.\n",
    "3. **Distribute Queries**: Route queries to the appropriate shard based on the shard key.\n",
    "4. **Handle Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across shards, especially in distributed transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example of sharding a user database:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shard Key**: User ID\n",
    "- **Shard 1**: Users with IDs 1-1000\n",
    "- **Shard 2**: Users with IDs 1001-2000\n",
    "- **Shard 3**: Users with IDs 2001-3000"

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "- **Choose an Appropriate Shard Key**: Select a shard key that evenly distributes data and minimizes the need for cross-shard queries.\n",
    "- **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of each shard to ensure balanced load.\n",
    "- **Plan for Growth**: Design your sharding strategy with future growth in mind.\n",
    "- **Use Consistent Hashing**: Implement consistent hashing to minimize resharding when adding or removing shards."

    "## Common Pitfalls\n",
    "- **Uneven Data Distribution**: Poorly chosen shard keys can lead to uneven data distribution and performance issues.\n",
    "- **Complex Query Handling**: Handling queries that span multiple shards can be complex and impact performance.\n",
    "- **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency across shards can be challenging, especially in distributed transactions.\n",
    "- **Resharding**: Resharding can be a complex and resource-intensive process."

    "## Advanced Topics\n",
    "- **Range-Based Sharding**: Dividing data based on a range of values.\n",
    "- **Hash-Based Sharding**: Using a hash function to determine the shard for each piece of data.\n",
    "- **List-Based Sharding**: Using a list of values to determine the shard for each piece of data.\n",
    "- **Auto-Sharding**: Implementing auto-sharding to automatically manage sharding as data grows."
