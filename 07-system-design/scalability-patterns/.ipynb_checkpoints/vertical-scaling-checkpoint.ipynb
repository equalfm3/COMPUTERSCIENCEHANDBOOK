    "## Overview\n",
    "Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine to handle increased load. This approach contrasts with horizontal scaling, which involves adding more machines to your pool of resources. Vertical scaling is often simpler to implement but has limitations in terms of scalability and fault tolerance."

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Single Machine**: Vertical scaling is performed on a single machine.\n",
    "- **Resource Augmentation**: Adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to the existing machine.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: There are physical limits to how much a single machine can be scaled.\n",
    "- **Cost**: Upgrading a single machine can be more cost-effective in the short term but may become expensive as the machine reaches its limits."

    "## Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "Vertical scaling relies on the principle of enhancing the capabilities of a single machine. This can be achieved by upgrading hardware components such as adding more CPU cores, increasing RAM, or expanding storage capacity. The goal is to improve the performance and capacity of the machine to handle increased workloads."

    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "To implement vertical scaling, you typically need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assess Current Usage**: Determine the current resource utilization of the machine.\n",
    "2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Identify which resources (CPU, RAM, I/O) are limiting performance.\n",
    "3. **Upgrade Hardware**: Add more CPU, RAM, or storage to the machine.\n",
    "4. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of the upgraded machine to ensure it meets the required demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an example of upgrading a server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current Configuration**: 2 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD\n",
    "- **Upgraded Configuration**: 4 CPU cores, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD"
